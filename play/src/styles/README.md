# Styles

Making styles apart of the JavaScript will leverage several things.
See vjeux's presentation on more information: https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js

It's best to put styles inline the component file, but for reusability place general reusable files here.

Everything should be orthoganal.

> React Style does not support CSS selectors, pseudo-classes and CSS animation. Mostly because we try to avoid implicit behaviour and want the user to make layout decisions inside the render() function.

See [React Styles](https://github.com/js-next/react-style/) for more information.
